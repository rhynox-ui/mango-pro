// src/core/relayQuote.ts
//
// Ported from mango-mobile's own src/bridge/relayBridge.js — same Relay
// Protocol request/response shape, same retry policy, hitting Relay's
// public API directly (https://api.relay.link) rather than the site's
// own backend proxy: mobile has no "same origin" server to route
// through the way the website does, and Mango Pro is in exactly the
// same position, so this follows mobile's pattern, not the site's.
//
// Every quote is tagged with the intent it was requested under (see
// quoteIntents below) — src/core/executeRelayQuote.ts reads this to run
// the pre-sign firewall before signing anything. This is the same
// pattern mango-bridge.jsx's own relaybridge.js uses: intent is built
// from the REQUEST body, never read back out of the response, or the
// check would be circular and worthless.
//
// Fee: every request attaches appFeeBpsForSponsoredTrade(). Whether
// `sponsoringGasOutright` is actually true is no longer a caller choice
// (nothing ever passed it — dead plumbing) — it's derived below from
// whether sponsorship is requested (RELAY_SPONSORSHIP_ENABLED), since the fee floor
// this protects only needs to exist once real sponsorship is live.
//
// Real gas sponsorship: Relay's own "Fee Sponsorship" feature
// (docs.relay.link/features/fee-sponsorship) — separate from the App
// Fees this file already sends via `appFees` below, which fund the
// protocol's own margin, not gas. Sponsorship needs an API key tied to
// a funded app balance. That key is held by mango-api, never by this app
// (an uploaded audit's H-01, verified: it used to be committed here and
// shipped in the APK, where anyone could extract it and spend Mango's
// Relay balance). Quotes go through Mango's proxy (mango-api
// pro-proxies.js), which adds the key, keeps sponsorship only on quotes
// carrying Mango's fee, and caps maxSubsidizationAmount server-side.
//
// Important, confirmed against Relay's own docs: sponsorship covers
// DESTINATION-chain fees only — the user still pays origin-chain gas
// themselves, on every trade, sponsored or not. UPDATE (stale comment
// fixed): this was true when first written but no longer is —
// TokenTradeScreen.tsx's payOrigin now lets a Buy pay from a DIFFERENT
// chain than the token being bought (a genuine cross-chain buy,
// fromChainKey !== toChainKey), and executeRelayQuote.ts signs each
// step on whichever chain Relay's own response actually names, not a
// single assumed chain. Same-chain buy/sell is still the common case
// (Sell, and a Buy where the user hasn't picked a different payOrigin
// chain), but it is no longer the ONLY case — verify with a real,
// funded key whether Relay's sponsorship has a visible effect on a
// genuine cross-chain trade now that one is real and reachable, not
// hypothetical future work.
