// Chain-aware fee floor for sponsored gas.
//
// The flat rate above is pure margin math — correct as long as gas is
// the USER's own cost (mobile/site/bot: they hold native gas and pay it
// themselves). Mango Pro's whole premise is gas SPONSORSHIP (a paymaster
// or fee-payer covers gas so the user doesn't need native tokens — build
// plan §1/§6), which turns gas into a real, chain-dependent cost the
// PROTOCOL eats. A flat 0.5% fee is fine on Solana/Base/most L2s, where
// sponsoring a transaction costs a fraction of a cent — but on Ethereum
// mainnet, sponsoring a small trade can cost more in gas than the flat
// fee collects, turning that trade into a real loss, not reduced margin.
//
// The fix has two parts, and this file only owns the second:
//  1. STRUCTURAL (preferred, per build plan §6): let the paymaster charge
//     gas in the token being traded instead of the protocol floating the
//     cost outright. Zero cost to the protocol, so the flat rate above
//     stays pure margin regardless of chain — use this wherever the
//     chosen AA provider (Phase 0 spike) supports it.
//  2. SAFETY NET (below): for any trade where gas IS being sponsored
//     outright, the fee must never fall below what that sponsorship
//     costs plus a minimum margin — appFeeBpsForSponsoredTrade() raises
//     the bps sent to Relay for exactly the small-trade-on-an-expensive-
//     chain case where the flat rate alone would lose money.
//
// SPONSORSHIP_COST_ESTIMATE_USD below is a conservative, STATIC estimate
// per chain — real gas prices move constantly (Ethereum mainnet
// especially, which can 5-10x during congestion), so this is a floor
// calibrated to be safely high under normal conditions, not a live
// quote. Replace with real-time gas-price-aware estimation (a viem
// estimateFeesPerGas() call + a native-asset price feed, per chain) once
// Phase 0's account-abstraction spike has real sponsored-transaction
// cost data to calibrate against — tracked, not solved, here.
//
// A Record (not Partial) on purpose, same discipline chainData.ts's own
// currencyAddress() uses: a chain added to ChainKey without an entry
// here is a compile error, not a silent gap that lets an unsponsored-
// cost chain slip through with no floor at all.

// chain, AND origin asset, destination asset can all differ in the same
// trade). This is not a hypothetical edge case to design for later — a
// token-first product makes combined bridge+swap trades the common
// path, not the exception.
//
// This is already handled correctly by the existing Relay integration
// this app inherits (mango-bridge.jsx's src/relaybridge.js,
// getRelayQuote()): ONE call takes originChainId/destinationChainId AND
// originCurrency/destinationCurrency together, with exactly ONE appFees
// entry (built from appFeeBps()/appFeeBpsForSponsoredTrade() above) on
// that single call — Relay's own solver handles the bridge-and-swap as
// one atomic route. There are no separate "bridge leg" and "swap leg"
// fees to accidentally add together, because there's no separate bridge
// leg and swap leg to begin with — it's one intent, one quote, one fee.
//
// The failure mode to actively avoid when Mango Pro's own router.ts
// (build plan §3, not yet built) starts choosing between routes: if it
// ever "manually" decomposes a cross-chain-and-cross-asset trade into
// two sequential calls (bridge via Relay to the destination chain, THEN
// a separate local swap via a DEX aggregator once funds land), each of
// those two calls would independently attach its own fee via this
// file's functions — silently doubling the effective rate charged for
// exactly the trade type this product is built around. Whenever a route
// genuinely does need two provider calls (e.g., a native bridge with no
// built-in swap step, requiring a same-chain swap afterward), compute
// and apply the fee on exactly ONE of the two legs, not both — never
// call appFeeBps()/appFeeBpsForSponsoredTrade() more than once for what
// the user experiences as a single trade.
