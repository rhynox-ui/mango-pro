// src/core/txIntentFirewall.ts
//
// Ported verbatim (logic unchanged, typed for this repo) from
// mango-bridge.jsx's own src/txIntentFirewall.js — the fix for that
// repo's security audit's P0 finding, and the exact thing
// src/core/relayQuote.ts's own header names as the blocker on real
// execution here: "Signing/broadcasting needs the intent-firewall +
// calldata-decode confirm screen ... which hasn't been ported into
// this app yet." This is that port. Execution itself (actually signing
// and sending the steps a Relay quote returns) is still a separate,
// not-yet-built step — this file only decides whether it's SAFE to.
//
// Checks a routing provider's returned transaction against what the
// user actually asked for, BEFORE it reaches a wallet for signature.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. executeRelayQuote (and any DEX-aggregator fallback
// path) takes `to`, `data`, `value` and `chainId` straight out of an
// HTTP response and hands them to sendTransaction. Every one of those
// is attacker-controlled the moment anything between the user and the
// router is compromised — the routing API, a CDN, a hostile response
// injected some other way. The user reviewed "buy $50 of PEPE" in this
// app's own trade screen; without this check, nothing compares that to
// the bytes actually being signed.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO. It cannot tell you what arbitrary router
// calldata does; decoding every DEX aggregator's encoding is not a thing
// a client can keep up with, and pretending otherwise would be worse
// than not trying. What it CAN do is bound the loss, using only fields
// that must be present for a transaction to be signed at all:
//
//   - Chain. Every item must name the chain the user chose. Without
//     this a response can omit chainId entirely, in which case a wallet
//     that only switches chains "when chainId is set" silently signs on
//     whatever chain it happens to be sitting on.
//   - Native value. The total native currency the transactions may move
//     is capped at the amount the user typed — and at ZERO when the
//     user is spending an ERC-20, where no native should move at all.
//   - Approvals. An `approve` in the origin token, to any spender, is
//     capped at the amount the user is spending. This is what blocks
//     the classic infinite-approval drain: the sequence looks like a
//     normal swap, and the router keeps the right to take the rest of
//     the balance afterwards.
//
// Together those bound the worst case to "the trade the user asked for
// went to the wrong place" instead of "the wallet was emptied". Calldata
// that does something else entirely still can't move more than the user
// staked on this trade.
//
// WHAT BLOCKS AND WHAT ONLY WARNS. A false positive here is not a
// harmless extra check — it is a user who cannot trade. So the blocking
// set is restricted to conditions that CANNOT legitimately occur:
// a chain we didn't ask for, a recipient or currency we didn't ask for,
// spending more native than the user typed, approving a token that
// isn't the one being spent, or approving a spender that no other
// transaction in this same quote even calls.
//
// Two genuinely suspicious patterns only WARN, because this could not
// be verified against the live routing API from the environment this
// was written in and both have legitimate explanations elsewhere in the
// industry: native value attached to an ERC-20 sale (some routes charge
// a native protocol fee in the same transaction) and an approval larger
// than the trade (many routers approve max-uint256 deliberately to save
// gas on later trades). They are returned to the caller instead of
// thrown. If Relay is ever confirmed never to do either, promoting them
// to blocks is a one-line change and the tests below already cover both
// directions.
//
// The quote-level checks below (currencies, chains, recipient) are the
// second layer and are deliberately NOT fail-closed on absence: every
// one of those fields is optional in Relay's own response schema, so
// requiring them would break real trades whenever Relay legitimately
// omits one. They are enforced when present. That asymmetry is
// intentional and is why the bounds above are written to hold on their
// own, without any help from `details`.
