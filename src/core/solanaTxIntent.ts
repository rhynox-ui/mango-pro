// src/core/solanaTxIntent.ts
//
// Ported verbatim (logic unchanged, typed for this repo) from
// mango-bridge.jsx's own src/solanaTxIntent.js — the Solana half of the
// pre-sign intent check; see txIntentFirewall.ts for the EVM half and
// the reasoning behind both.
//
// The audit finding this exists for: a Solana path that simulates
// before signing proves the transaction will SUCCEED but says nothing
// about whether it does what the user asked. A transaction that drains
// the wallet simulates perfectly.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not try to prove a route
// is correct by decoding every AMM's instruction layout — Solana routes
// go through whichever program the solver picked, and a client-side
// allowlist of program IDs would break on the first new venue Relay
// adds. Attempting that would produce a check that fails honest trades,
// which is worse than no check.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. One thing that cannot legitimately be wrong, as a hard
// block, and an inventory of things worth knowing as warnings:
//
//   BLOCK — the fee payer must be either the user's own account, or an
//   explicitly-passed sponsor (Mango's own fee-payer service, fetched
//   from our own backend — see executeRelayQuote.ts's sponsored-signing
//   path). A transaction presented to this wallet whose fee payer is
//   neither is not this user's trade.
//
//   BLOCK — the user's own account must appear as a REQUIRED SIGNER
//   somewhere in the transaction. This is what still ties a
//   sponsor-paid transaction back to the user: the sponsor covering the
//   fee doesn't mean the sponsor is authorizing the trade — the user's
//   own signature, on the actual swap/transfer instructions, still has
//   to be there.
//
//   BLOCK — an spl-token Approve or SetAuthority, because they grant or
//   change standing authority over the user's token account.
//   CloseAccount is different: Relay/Jupiter routes can legitimately use
//   it to clean up an emptied token account or WSOL account. It is allowed
//   only when the user's own signer is both the close authority and the
//   destination for the recovered lamports.
//
// Parsing is deliberately structural — compiled instruction program IDs
// and the first byte of each instruction's data — so it works on both a
// legacy Transaction and a VersionedTransaction without depending on
// any SDK's decoder staying stable.
