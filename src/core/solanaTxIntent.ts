// src/core/solanaTxIntent.ts
//
// Ported verbatim (logic unchanged, typed for this repo) from
// mango-bridge.jsx's own src/solanaTxIntent.js — the Solana half of the
// pre-sign intent check; see txIntentFirewall.ts for the EVM half and
// the reasoning behind both.
//
// The audit finding this exists for: a Solana path that simulates
// before signing proves the transaction will SUCCEED but says nothing
// about whether it does what the user asked. A transaction that drains
// the wallet simulates perfectly.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not try to prove a route
// is correct by decoding every AMM's instruction layout — Solana routes
// go through whichever program the solver picked, and a client-side
// allowlist of program IDs would break on the first new venue Relay
// adds. Attempting that would produce a check that fails honest trades,
// which is worse than no check.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. One thing that cannot legitimately be wrong, as a hard
// block, and an inventory of things worth knowing as warnings:
//
//   BLOCK — the fee payer (the first required signature) must be the
//   user's own account. This is the account that pays and, in every
//   route this app builds, the account that funds the trade. A
//   transaction presented to this wallet whose fee payer is somebody
//   else is not this user's trade.
//
//   WARN — an spl-token Approve, which hands a delegate standing
//   authority over the user's token account (Solana's equivalent of an
//   unlimited ERC-20 approval), and SetAuthority/CloseAccount, which
//   change or dissolve an account the user owns. None of the three
//   belongs in a swap route. They warn rather than block only because
//   this could not be checked against a live Relay Solana quote from
//   the environment it was written in; promoting them is a one-line
//   change once a real route is observed not to use them.
//
// Parsing is deliberately structural — compiled instruction program IDs
// and the first byte of each instruction's data — so it works on both a
// legacy Transaction and a VersionedTransaction without depending on
// any SDK's decoder staying stable.
