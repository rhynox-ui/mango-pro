// src/core/executeRelayQuote.ts
//
// Turns a getRelayQuote() result into signed, broadcast transactions —
// the piece relayQuote.ts's own earlier header named as the blocker on
// real trading, and the reason src/core/txIntentFirewall.ts and
// solanaTxIntent.ts were ported first. Direct-broadcast, same confirmed
// architecture as the rest of this app's wallet code (sendUsdc.ts):
// this device signs with the session's own key and submits straight to
// each chain, no backend in between.
//
// Two references combined, neither ported alone:
// - mango-bridge.jsx's own src/relaybridge.js for HOW the firewall gets
//   wired into execution: read the intent tagged onto the quote object
//   (relayQuote.ts's own intentForQuote()), run assertQuoteSafeToSign
//   against every still-pending item BEFORE signing the first one, log
//   (never swallow) any warnings, THEN sign step by step.
// - mango-mobile's own src/bridge/relayBridge.js for the actual signing
//   mechanics, since the site signs through wagmi/an external wallet
//   and this app IS the wallet: sendRelayEvmStep's pre-flight simulate
//   + native-balance check (a clear "insufficient ETH for gas" instead
//   of a wallet just failing), and signAndSendRelaySolanaStep's hardened
//   retry (insufficient-lamports detection, and a skipPreflight retry +
//   landed-check for the well-documented case where a public RPC's own
//   stale simulation snapshot rejects a transaction that the real
//   cluster accepts a moment later).
//
// Solana routes may still contain WSOL internally when Relay/Jupiter
// needs it; the intent firewall now validates legitimate cleanup rather
// than assuming every CloseAccount is malicious.
// so there's nothing left to unwrap (see mobile's own long comment on
// why that fix made the whole cleanup path unnecessary going forward).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Sponsorship cost recovery — closing the loop the fee-payer wallet's
// own header (mango-api's solana-fee-payer.js) explicitly leaves open:
// with the per-address/daily caps removed, this wallet keeps covering
// sponsored trades until it runs dry, with no other backstop. This
// section is what refills it, WITHOUT ever risking the trade it's
// supposed to be protecting — see the design contract below.
//
// Design, per real precedent (Kora/Circle Gas Station/Openfort docs —
// all recover cost with an SPL transfer to the fee payer's own account,
// executed INSIDE the same sponsored transaction, not a quote-time %):
//
//  1. RECOVER EXACTLY REAL COST, PLUS A NON-PROFIT BUFFER. The amount is
//     this transaction's own measured lamports cost (base fee + any
//     rent this fee payer is now funding — read from the ORIGINAL,
//     pre-rewrite instructions, not guessed), priced live via
//     walletPrices.ts's SOL/USD feed (so it tracks SOL's own volatility
//     instead of a stale $ constant), plus SPONSORSHIP_RECOVERY_BUFFER_PCT
//     — sized only to cover the eventual USDC->SOL conversion cost when
//     this wallet's accumulated USDC gets swept back into SOL, never a
//     margin on top of real cost. Explicit product decision: recovering
//     MORE than what sponsorship actually cost is the same "cheating"
//     the flat appFeeBpsForSponsoredTrade()/sponsoredFeeFloorUsd() path
//     in fees.ts already exists to avoid on the Relay-sponsorship side.
//
//  2. NEVER IN THE WAY OF THE TRADE. Recovery is denominated in USDC and
//     paid from whatever USDC the user's wallet already holds (checked
//     against a live balance, not assumed) — deliberately NOT tied to
//     this specific swap's own origin/destination currency, so it works
//     the same whether the swap is a Buy or a Sell, paid in USDC or in
//     anything else. If the user doesn't hold enough USDC, or ANYTHING
//     about the augmented transaction fails to simulate clean (a stale
//     balance snapshot, a compute-budget conflict, whatever), the whole
//     recovery attempt is dropped and the plain, already-working
//     sponsored transaction is sent instead — recovery is strictly
//     opportunistic, the trade succeeding is not.
//
//  3. MEASURE, DON'T GUESS, THE COMPUTE BUDGET. An added SPL transfer
//     costs real compute units Relay's own route never budgeted for
//     (https://57blocks.com/blog/deep-dive-into-resource-limitations-in-solana-development-cu-edition).
//     The augmented instruction set is simulated BEFORE it's ever
//     signed (sigVerify: false, replaceRecentBlockhash: true — the same
//     pattern mango-api's own coSignAsFeePayer already uses server-side)
//     and, only if that simulation comes back clean, its real
//     unitsConsumed is used to correct (or add) a SetComputeUnitLimit
//     instruction to ~110% of that measured value
//     (https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-compute-budget) — never a
//     flat guessed number.
//
// The sponsor's own USDC associated token account is created lazily,
